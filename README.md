  ## Introducing OSINTBuddy

  <p>
      Welcome to the OSINTBuddy project where you can connect, combine,
      and get insight from unstructured and public data as results that
      can be explored step-by-step. An easy-to-use plugin system allows any
      Python developer to quickly integrate new data sources so you can focus 
      on discovering, interacting, and visualizing what's important to you

### What is <a referrerpolicy="unsafe-url" target="_blank" href="https://osintbuddy.com">osintbuddy.com</a>?


Not much, yet.


But here's the concept:


An almost incomprehensible amount of data is created every day. And each year, figures are growing at an ever-increasing rate. These data sources can be divided up into six different categories of information flow:

- Public government data
- Media *(newspapers, magazines, radio)*
- Internet *(blogs, discussion groups, citizen media, etc)*
- Professional and academic publications *(budgets, hearings, telephone directories, websites, etc)*
- Commercial data *(commercial imagery, financial assessments, databases, etc)*
- Grey literature *(technical reports, preprints, patents, business documents, etc)*


OSINT is a method of working with, assessing and ranking information — We are living in the [information age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age) and the volume of information OSINT research has to deal with [(information explosion)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_explosion) and the issue of low quality data leaves researchers drowning. The majority of this data is unstructured introducing many challenges to analyzing it and producing actionable intelligence since most data analytics databases are designed for structured data. We are surrounded by information and nearly none of it is useful. 


We've decided to do something about it. The rapid developments in technologies such as AI and big data analytics have opened new horizons for OSINT which weren't previously available. We want to put all of that information at your fingertips. We want actionable intelligence quickly and to the point, that's why we're building an open-source OSINT tool that's free. Free to use, free to modify, free to do with as you wish, and built with plain old web technologies anyone can learn. But this isn't really the project. This is a free new community. A community for OSINT enthusiasts around the world and we need your help to design it, to program it, and to build it. We want to hear your suggestions, your ideas, and we're going to build it right in front of your eyes. The notion of a “needle in a haystack” is taken to the extreme on the internet. Let's build a magnet.


### Key Alpha Features
- Simplified data fetching from custom sources using Python plugins.
- Visual representation of fetched data for easy understanding.
- A development platform that is open for contributions.
- Plugin-based system for transforming data, check out the [osintbuddy](https://pypi.org/project/osintbuddy/) package.
- Works most of the time :)


### The future

At the core of this project lies a far more ambitious vision than the mere creation of an all-in-one data aggregation and analysis tool. What we aspire to start is the birth of a knowledge-driven community, passionately dedicated to the development of an evolving intelligence tool - a system and platform designed for discovering, interacting, and visualizing information to derive actionable insights. We imagine a system that not only learns from and evolves with your skills but also augments them. Here are some of our ideas for the future in no particular order:


#### Intuitive search and discovery tools

- We want you to be able to interact with our algorithms, filter, segment, search for particular data, apply advanced query filters, data layouts, build queries visually, and more so you can uncover insights that matter via an easy-to-navigate web-based interface.


#### Collective intelligence through collaborative workspaces

- We want to create a platform that promotes collective intelligence. Think of the currently popular collaborative workspaces such as AFFiNE, Logseq, or Obsidian but built into our data workspace. A system where each individual user contributes to the pool of knowledge, where you can share your graph environments, where you can track changes with annotations and comments, where insights from your workspaces can be optionally published and engaged with by a global community. Where every connection made, every data source integrated, every plugin created and shared by members of our community contributes to advancing insights around the world. 


#### Real-time monitoring

- We want functionality that can provide real-time updates for a set of entities or scans, notifying you when theres new data, changes, and or emerging patterns in your field of interest. Automatically retrieve insights as time goes on and learn from history with snapshots of your past data.


#### History graphs

- We want to create a browser extension that allows you to seamlessly browse the web while also populating your OSINTBuddy graph. Each website you visit is mapped as an entity, with lines connecting them in the sequence you’ve traveled. Not just a bookmark list or a history tab, the history graph could maintain the context, showing not just where you’ve been, but also how and when you got there, and with the ability to extract a comment or piece of data out of a website you visit into an entity, you'll rarely have to leave your favorite web browser. 


#### AI, swarm intelligence, and evolutionary algorithms

- Integrating AI, swarm intelligence, and evolutionary algorithms could let us create a tool that can continually evolve and optimize your operations over time. From NLP and sentiment analysis to search and anomaly detection with swarm intelligence, bringing data science tools and techniques to OSINTBuddy could let use create a powerful tool that reveals deep insights among a "haystack" of noisy information. 


This is a project that will most likely not be finished for many years if ever, and that will require collaboration among experts in many fields. We're always looking for help, from writing documentation, researching feature ideas, designing the UX/UI, donating, to simply marketing and sharing the project, anything you contribute helps realize a vision for what could turn into a cross-disciplinary toolkit for working with information. Will you join me?


## Getting Started

To start using OSINTBuddy, follow these simple installation steps:

### Installation
1. Clone the repo and submodules
   ```sh
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/jerlendds/osintbuddy.git
   cd osintbuddy
   # using ssh?
   # git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:jerlendds/osintbuddy.git 
   ```

2. Install Docker & Compose
    - [Install Guide for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
    - [Install Guide for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)
    - [Install Guide for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)

3. Start the stack with Docker:
   ```sh
   # ./launcher               # display usage information.
   # ./launcher bootstrap     # first time working on osintbuddy? build images and 
   #                            setup development environments for the frontend and backend.
     ./launcher start         # start the osintbuddy stack.
   ```
   - **Note:** the stack will take a few minutes to startup while Solr and ScyllaDB configure themselves for JanusGraph. If you try to connect before all the databases are ready you will encounter errors.

- **URLs**
  - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
  - Casdoor: http://localhost:45910
  - Backend: http://localhost:48997/api
  - Documentation: http://localhost:48997/docs

[Why the AGPLv3?](https://ploum.net/2023-06-19-more-rms.html)

> In the early eighties, RMS realised that software was transformed from "a way to use a machine" to a product or a commodity. He foresaw that this would put an end to collective intelligence and to knowledge sharing.

> For the last 30 years, businesses and proponents of Open Source, including Linus Torvalds, have been decrying the GPL because of the essential right of "doing business" aka "privatising the common". Microsoft, through Github, Google and Apple pushed for MIT/BSD licensed software as the open source standard.

> Our freedoms were taken away by proprietary software which is mostly coded by ourselves. For free. We spent our free time developing, debugging, testing software before handing them to corporations that we rever, hoping to maybe get a job offer or a small sponsorship from them. Without Non-copyleft Open Source, there would be no proprietary MacOS, OSX nor Android. There would be no Facebook, no Amazon. We created all the components...

### The four freedoms and one obligation of free software
- The right to use the software at your own discretion
- The right to study the software
- The right to modify the software
- The right to redistribute the software, including with modifications
- The obligation to keep those four rights, effectively keeping the software in the commons.

> We need to realize that any software without that last obligation will, sooner or later, become an oppression tool against ourselves. And that maintaining the commons is not only about software. It’s about everything we are as a society and everything we are losing against individual greed.
